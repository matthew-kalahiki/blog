I was in charge of the first section of the tutorial for my team, and as far as I know, everything went swimmingly. There is a possibility that something that I did messed up the rest of the lab for my other group members, but not that I know of. Also, I know that many groups had trouble with issues relating to Hendrix wifi, but I never used Hendrix wifi, so I didn't really have any problems
