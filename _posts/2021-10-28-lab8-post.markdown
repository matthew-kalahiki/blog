I think that this lab was easier than the previous one, most likely because there were many similar parts so there was less new material that I had to learn. The easiest parts, of course, were the parts that were the same as the last lab, and the hardest part was learning how to implement the connections between each table. Actually doing it was easy, but I tried understanding everything a bit more so that I could prepare for the final project. This said, I feel like this lab was very helpful in terms of the final project, especially considereing that our project has one main table while the rest simply ensure the consistancy of the data.
