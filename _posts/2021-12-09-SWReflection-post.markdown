The most valuable skill in carrying out the goals of our client was efficiently accessing and portraying information from a back end database and portraying said information to the user. It was very important to our client that people were able to access information for any one of the many trees on campus, so communicating this information from a server to the user was very important. This said, I have found that through the course of working on this project, I have become very efficient in communicating information from a server to the user of a website.

Our community partner wanted to perpetuate accessibility to information of various trees in order to ignite awareness and enthusiasm about the numerous trees on campus. At Hendrix, every tree is tagged with an id number, and there is no doubt that various students and community members are interested in these trees, but it isn't easy to simply google information about a tree simply based off of what the tree looks like. Furthermore, I believe that a website to generate accessibility to a tree's information is the perfect way to raise awareness for the trees on campus.

This experience has shined a light on the importance of data accessibility and the effect that it has on the current generation. In the context of our project, the data for each tree has always been available, just not accessible to the public, but with the help of our website, anyone interested will be more educated on the trees on campus.

In conclusion, this experience has led me to realize that there are many issues in contemporary society that need attention called to them. Many of these issues may not seem prevalent in your community until an individual or organization take the effort to shine light on the problem and work to find a solution.
