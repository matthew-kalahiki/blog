Setting up this blog was a very new experience for me. I never really used the command prompt often, so now I feel more experienced in using it. My main struggle was figuring out what was wrong with my installation of jekyll, but it turns out, the issue was just in the format of my console commands. I don't think there is anything in particular that still doesn't make since, but I'm still going to have to figure out what each file in the blog means and how to utilize them. I am looking forward to the following things:

- learning how to efficiently use ruby
- learning how to change the design of my Blog
- learning how to use markdown instead of html

Here are some helpful links to getting started:
